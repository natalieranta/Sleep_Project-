# Sleep_Project-
a Machine Learning (ML)-based fine-grained sleep detection is achieved
using acceleration, heart rate and time data recorded by a wrist
worn Apple Watch. Several ML-based classifiers were used for
this purpose and a comparative study is performed to identify
the classifier with the best performance. The results obtained by
the classifiers were validated against the gold standard in sleep
detection. The proposed models achieved an accuracy of 95% for
3 sleep stages prediction and 75% for all sleep stages prediction
